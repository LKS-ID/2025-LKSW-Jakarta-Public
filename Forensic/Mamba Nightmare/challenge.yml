  My DFIR analyst acquaintance just gave me a malware stealer-type that does something. He says that one of its capability is to screenshot all the screens connected in the monitor, even from the HDMI, USB-C, and stuff.
  Can you help me to clarify what's the prefix filename saved in the disk when the screenshot is successfully taken?
  
  **WARNING: DO NOT RUN THE SCRIPT IN YOUR HOST ENVIRONMENT**

  Unzip the file with password = infected

  Flag format = `LKSJ{prefixfilename}`

  Example, if the screenshotted filename is called "Tungtung saba.jfif", then the answer is LKSJ{Tungtung}.
